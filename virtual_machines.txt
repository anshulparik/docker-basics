=> Virtual Machine:


Applications

Windows OS

Hardware => CPU  +  RAM  +  Storage

NOTE: If we want to run Linux on the system, we will be requiring another system but with virtualization
- No separate hardware needed.

Linux OS

Virtualization (Type 2 Hypervisor)

Windows OS

Hardware => CPU  +  RAM  +  Storage

- We can achieve this using Hypervisor.
- Hypervisor is a technology that allows hosting multiple virtual computers on a physical computer on top 
  of the we already have on our system.
- Hypervisor example: Virtual box from Oracle.  
- Virtual box takes hardware resources from Host OS.
- Creates virtual CPU, virtual RAM, virtual Storage for each virtual machine.
- We can only give access to hardware resources that are actually on the system.
- Virtual machines are completely isolated.
- If something breaks in VM, it doesn't affect the host machine.
- This Hypervisor is called Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor).
- These are majorly used for personal computers.

=> Usecases of Type 2 Hypervisor:
- Used in personal computers.
- Used for learning activites.
- Used to test application on multiple platforms.


=> Type 1 Hypervisor:
- These are majorly used for large servers.
- This Hypervisor is directly installed on top of hardware.
- Also called Bare Metal Hypervisor.
- Example: vmware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-v



Linux OS

Virtualization (Type 1 Hypervisor)

Hardware => CPU  +  RAM  +  Storage


=> Usecases of Type 1 Hypervisor:
- Used in large companies.
- Big cloud companies runs their infrastructure on this. 


=> Benefits of Virtualization:
- Efficient usage of hardware resources.
  - Use all the resources of the performant big server.
  - Users can choose any resource combinations.
- Abstraction of the OS from the hardware.  
  - Without virtualization:
    - OS is tightly coupled to the hardware.
    - If hardware failed and couldn't be repaired then all the data will be gone.
  
  - With virtualization:
    - OS as a portable file (VM Image).
    - We can have backups of our entire OS (OS Snapshots).
    - Secure very easily. If something happen to our existing VM we can run backup snapshot
      on another VM.
    - Portable
